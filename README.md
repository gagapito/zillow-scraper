# Zillow Scraper

A scraper designed to collect information from a Zillow webpage for house listiings. The information collected is the address, latitiude, longitude, floorSize, price and url of the listing. I wrote the script in Python and used BeautifulSoup to request information and parse through the json script contained within the webpage. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to design a scraper that can collect information from a webpage and display it in a csv file. This is to demonstrate my ability using BeautifulSoup and Python to collect and organize data in a meaningful and cohesive way that is easy to interpret.
